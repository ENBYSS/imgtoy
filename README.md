# imgtoy

A "toy" that can apply modifications to images - including common filters, dithering, palette generation, randomness, and more.

Originally in the [image-tool-assortment](https://github.com/ENBYSS/image-tool-assortment) repository - split off due to growing a lot in scope.

## Quick Setup

Just run `./run.sh`, which will compile and run the project as _"release"_ using the default `option.yaml`.

### Alternative

Run `cargo build --release` manually do get the executable from `target/release/imgtoy`.
